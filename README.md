## Interpreting the Data
phone is attached to the ankle facing outwards.
x: leg moving forward/backwarad
y: leg moving up/down
z: leg moving side to side

## TODO
-get datasets: normal, limp, dragging feet
-smooth/clean data (butterworth filter)
-get frequency of steps (FFT, fourier transform)
-transform acceleration to velocity to position (Δv = a⋅Δt and Δp = v⋅Δt.)
-check normality/variance 
-statistical test to see if datasets differ (anova, u-test, t-test)
-compare different steps
-train ml to detect injury

-plots: 
    -raw data (before/after smoothing)
    -velocity
    -position
